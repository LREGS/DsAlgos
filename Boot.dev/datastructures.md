# Trees 

A tree of collection of nodes that start with a root/head node. Each node can have multiple children

The main distinction is that a parent can have multiple children, but a child only one parent

# Binary Tree 

A tree is made up of nodes with a reference to a node with at most 2 other nodes 

Binary trees are always pre sorted, values to the left are always less than the parent node and the one to the right is the highest of the pair but can be larger than the parent node 

In a binary tree the number of comparisons is limited to the height of the tree. Because of the way it is sorted you can quickly eleminate other branches of the tree from searches
